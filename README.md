# CSSI PI Meeting 2022

This NSF PI meeting aims at further building the community around the NSF CSSI and its precursor programs (DIBBs, SI2) toward a national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. The meeting provides a forum for PIs to share technical information about their projects with each other, NSF program directors and others; to explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss and learn about best practices across projects; and to stimulate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability and new collaborations.
