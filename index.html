			<h2>2022 NSF Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) Principal Investigator Meeting</h2>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				<p class="tagline">Towards a Sustainable Data and Software Cyberinfrastructure</p>
				<p>July 25-26, 2022 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexandria, Virginia</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			The 2022 NSF CSSI PI meeting aims to further build the community around the <a href="https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific-innovation-cssi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> NSF CSSI</a> and its precursor programs (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIBBs</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503489&org=NSF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SI2</a>) towards a sustainable data and software cyberinfrastructure. The meeting provides a forum for CSSI PIs to: 
			<ul>
				<li>share technical information about their projects with others including NSF program directors; </li>
				<li>explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities;</li>
				<li>discuss and learn about best practices across projects;</li>
				<li>consider ways to ensure a diverse pipeline of CI researchers and professionals;</li>
				<li>investigate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			At least one representative (PI/Co-PI/senior personnel) from each active CSSI project is required by NSF to attend the meeting and present a poster on their project. For a <strong>collaborative project with multiple awards</strong>, one representative from the entire project is required. There is no registration fee, but participants should register by the deadline <strong>July 7, 2022</strong> to allow for planning logistics such as space and food. We plan to livestream the talks and panel discussions via Zoom.

									<p>The goal of this project is to provide the scientific community with easily accessible high-quality atomic data and user-friendly broadly-applicable modern relativistic code to treat electronic correlations. The code will be capable of calculating a very broad range of atomic properties to answer the significant needs of atomic, plasma, and astrophysics communities. We also propose a creation on an online portal for high-precision atomic physics data and computation that will provide a variety of services to address the needs of the widest possible community of users. The portal will contribute a novel element to today's U.S.  cyberinfrastructure ecosystem, improving usability and access for the atomic physics community and their fields of application.</p>

		<h2>Poster Presentations</h2>
		  <p>
			  Each active CSSI project is expected to present a poster on the project at the PI meeting. You will need to print out and bring a physical copy of your poster on your own; we cannot print posters on site. Collaborative projects (including across multiple institutions) should only bring one poster. We will assign you to one of four poster sessions and notify you once the agenda is finalized in July.
		  </p>

			      Each poster presenter will be assigned one side of a poster board. The poster board dimensions are <strong>72 inches (183 cm) wide and 48 inches (122 cm) tall</strong> and you are free to fill that space however you see fit. We will provide pushpins. Please include your project award name, award number, and PI/co-PI names. Posters left after the meeting will be recycled.

		<p>
			To optimize time for in-person interaction, we will limit lightning talks to recently-funded (2019-present) projects that did not have a chance to present a lightning talk at previous CSSI PI meetings. These projects will give a one-minute lightning talk to introduce their poster. To avoid any technical issues and minimize delays between talks, one slide per lightning talk should be submitted by <strong>July 18, 2022</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each slide should include the following information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Project title</li>

			<li>NSF award number</li>
			<li>NSF program that funds the project</li>

									<p>Image registration is an inherently ill-posed problem that lacks a unique mapping between voxels of the two images being registered. As such, we must confine the registration to only physically meaningful transforms by regularizing it via an appropriate penalty term which can be calculated numerically or analytically. The numerical approach, however, is computationally expensive depending on the image size, and therefore analytical methods are preferable. Using cubic B-splines as the basis for registration, we develop a generalized mathematical framework that accommodates five distinct types of regularizers: diffusion, curvature, linear elastic, third-order, and total displacement. We validate our approach by testing the accuracy achieved by each of the regularizers against their numerical counterpart. We also provide benchmarking results showing that the analytic solutions run significantly faster --- up to two orders of magnitude --- than central-differencing based numerical solutions.<br /><br />As a case study, we show how to use deformable registration to improve the accuracy of the Multi-atlas based segmentation (MABS). The effect of various regularizers on MABS accuracy is compared using the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics.</p>

		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
		<p>
			The 2022 NSF CSSI PI Meeting is an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the 2022 NSF CSSI PI Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Definition of Sexual Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behavior and language that are welcome/acceptable to one person may be unwelcome/offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.<br /><br />
				Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. The following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Other Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Discrimination:</dt>
			<dd>
				Discrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person's competence or suitability.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Retaliation:</dt>
			<dd>
				Retaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment.
			</dd>
			<dt>Reporting an Incident:</dt>
			<dd>
				Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported immediately to the Organizing Committee Members (email: <strong>cssi-pi-meeting2022 at googlegroups dot com</strong>). All complaints will be treated seriously and be investigated promptly. Confidentiality will be honored to the extent permitted as long as the rights of others are not compromised.  Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the 2022 NSF CSSI PI Meeting, to the notification of appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.
