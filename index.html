									<p>The goal of this project is to provide the scientific community with easily accessible high-quality atomic data and user-friendly broadly-applicable modern relativistic code to treat electronic correlations. The code will be capable of calculating a very broad range of atomic properties to answer the significant needs of atomic, plasma, and astrophysics communities. We also propose a creation on an online portal for high-precision atomic physics data and computation that will provide a variety of services to address the needs of the widest possible community of users. The portal will contribute a novel element to today's U.S.  cyberinfrastructure ecosystem, improving usability and access for the atomic physics community and their fields of application.</p>

									<p>In developing investment priorities, the CSSI programs seeks to engage the capabilities, curiosity and creativity CI research community PIs. Ongoing feedback from and dialogue with PIs from the CI research community is therefore critical. Surveys are an efficient and effective mechanism for staying connected and collecting input. This session describes the methodology and results of a survey of principal investigators (PIs), co-PIs, and others the CI research community. The survey, which was carried out by the Nexight Group under the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) Award (#1930025), had two primary purposes. First, the survey was designed to inform decisions about changes to be made to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) solicitation. Second, the survey was designed to inform decisions about the future direction and focus of the NSF CSSI umbrella program. The survey results provide insights that enhance CSSI’s support of a cyberinfrastructure for scientific research.</p>

									<p>Reasoning about real-world social habitats often represented as  multiplexed co-evolving networks is complicated and scientifically challenging due to their size, co-evolutionary nature and the need for representing multiple dynamical processes simultaneously. The 2014 Ebola epidemic, 2009 financial crisis, global migration, societal impacts of natural and human initiated disasters and the effect of climate change provide examples of the many challenges faced when developing such environments.  Advances in computing has fundamentally altered how such networks can be synthesized, analyzed and reasoned.</p>
									<p>We will briefly describe our work on co-evolving socio-technical networks by drawing on our work in urban transport planning, national security and public health epidemiology to guide the discussion. We will conclude by describing an exciting new project funded by the NSF that aims to develop CINES: a scalable cyberinfrastructure for network science.  CINES builds on a prior NSF project, CINET and serve as a community resource for network science. CINES provide an extensible platform for producers and consumers of network science data, information, and software.</p>

									<p>Soil moisture is a critical variable that links climate dynamics with water and food security. It regulates land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., via evapotranspiration---the loss of water from evaporation and plant transpiration to the atmosphere), and it is directly linked with plant productivity and plant survival. The current availability in soil moisture data over large areas comes from remote sensing (i.e., satellites with radar sensors), which provides nearly global coverage of soil moisture at spatial resolution of tens of kilometers. Satellite soil moisture data has two main shortcomings. First, although satellites can provide daily global information, they are limited to coarse spatial resolution (at the multi-kilometer scale). Second, satellites are unable to measure soil moisture in areas of dense vegetation, snow cover, or extremely dry surfaces; this results in gaps in the data.</p>
									<p>In this talk, we will present how we address these two shortcomings with a modular SOil MOisture Spatial Inference Engine (SOMOSPIE). SOMOSPIE consists of modular components including input of available data at its native spatial resolution, selection of a geographic region of interest, prediction of missing values across the entire region of interest (i.e., gap-filling), analysis of generated predictions, and visualization of both predictions and analyses. To predict soil moisture, our engine leverages hydrologically meaningful terrain parameters (e.g., slope and topographic wetness index) calculated using an open source platforms for standard terrain analysis (i.e., SAGA-GIS or System for Automated GeoScientific Analysis-Geographical Information System) and a suite of machine learning methods. We will present empirical studies of the engine's functionality including an assessment of data processing and fine-grained predictions over United States ecological regions with a highly diverse soil moisture profile.</p>

									<p>Image registration is an inherently ill-posed problem that lacks a unique mapping between voxels of the two images being registered. As such, we must confine the registration to only physically meaningful transforms by regularizing it via an appropriate penalty term which can be calculated numerically or analytically. The numerical approach, however, is computationally expensive depending on the image size, and therefore analytical methods are preferable. Using cubic B-splines as the basis for registration, we develop a generalized mathematical framework that accommodates five distinct types of regularizers: diffusion, curvature, linear elastic, third-order, and total displacement. We validate our approach by testing the accuracy achieved by each of the regularizers against their numerical counterpart. We also provide benchmarking results showing that the analytic solutions run significantly faster --- up to two orders of magnitude --- than central-differencing based numerical solutions.<br /><br />As a case study, we show how to use deformable registration to improve the accuracy of the Multi-atlas based segmentation (MABS). The effect of various regularizers on MABS accuracy is compared using the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics.</p>

		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
		<p>
			The 2022 NSF CSSI PI Meeting is an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the 2022 NSF CSSI PI Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Definition of Sexual Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behavior and language that are welcome/acceptable to one person may be unwelcome/offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.<br /><br />
				Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. The following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Other Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Discrimination:</dt>
			<dd>
				Discrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person's competence or suitability.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Retaliation:</dt>
			<dd>
				Retaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment.
			</dd>
			<dt>Reporting an Incident:</dt>
			<dd>
				Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported immediately to the Organizing Committee Members (email: <strong>cssi-pi-meeting2022 at googlegroups dot com</strong>). All complaints will be treated seriously and be investigated promptly. Confidentiality will be honored to the extent permitted as long as the rights of others are not compromised.  Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the 2022 NSF CSSI PI Meeting, to the notification of appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.
